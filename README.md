# Indian-classifier-and-skin-tone-recognition

This model is basically the advance or more featured version of the 'Indian and Non-Indian classification'(https://github.com/Geooris/Indian-and-Non-Indian-classification)

This model has a new function called as skin_tone, that finds the skin tone of the image if that image is a Indian origin human. Basically it detect three type of skin tone, i.e, Fair, Mild and Dark.

Will be adding this to the main project(Indian and Non-Indian classification) as a new fucntion with importing the python file.
